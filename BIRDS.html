<h1>BIRDS</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Birds belong to the class Aves and are characterized by feathers, wings, and a beak.</li>
<li>They have lightweight bones and a strong respiratory system that enables flight.</li>
<li>There are over 10,000 species of birds, each with unique physical and behavioral adaptations.</li>
<li>Birds lay eggs and have a high metabolism, which allows them to maintain their body temperature and fly.</li>
<li>Many birds migrate long distances, some traveling thousands of miles between their breeding and wintering grounds</li>
<li>Birds play important roles in ecosystems, serving as pollinators, seed dispersers, and prey for other animals.</li>
<li>Some species, such as pigeons and parrots, have been domesticated and are popular as pets.</li>
<li>Human activities, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change, threaten many bird populations.</li>
<li>Bird watching and conservation efforts aim to protect and preserve bird species and their habitats.</li>
</ul>
